            <h1>PRELIMINARY STUDY,WELL TESTING, MOBILIZATION</h1>
            <p class="fonts">When you call Oanam professional service and express interest in drilling a well, our first step is to access historical records. Historical records will indicate existing water wells in the area and provide depth and production reports. This information helps us not only know where to drill but how deep we will need to drill to access the natural water source, which helps us provide you with an accurate quote for the service.
            After the contract has been formalized,our technical team will visit the site along with geologists to identify the best place to carry out the drilling process.
            After development and preliminary tests, a long-duration well test is carried out. Well tests have to be carried out on all newly completed wells, because not only does this give an indication of the success of the drilling, design and development, but it also yields formation on aquifer parameters which are vital to the hydrogeologist.
            The drilling rig accompanied by a support truck will reach the site. Based on the soil and rock
            formation conditions, we would take approximately 3 hours to prepare for the drilling process.

           <h1>DRILLING PROCESS</h1>
           <p class="fonts">At Oanam Professional services, we take pleasure in offering a complete service that covers all areas of the project. Water borehole drilling services, complete with filtration, pumping, and control equipment, are designed, specified, and installed by us across Nigeria. Oanam Professional services experienced borehole specialists  have worked on a variety of projects, both residential and commercial. Water wells are being drilled for a variety of uses, including drinking water, irrigation, and livestock. Through provide you with the most comprehensive service possible, HUB
            Oanam Professional services offers a full range of borehole drilling services, from first consultation to water extraction with pump installation.
            The drilling is carried out by using the “Down-The-Hole” (DTH) technology. This system works by using high compressed air built within our drilling rig. The size of the hole can vary depending on the requirements of the client. As the drilling process continues, geological rock samples are taken at 2 meter intervals. Struck and water rest levels are constantly recorded. This process enables us to estimate the yield of individual aquifers encountered.

     <h2> WHAT IS A SUBMERSIBLE PUMP?</h2>  
  <p class="fonts">  As the name suggests a submersible pump is a pump that can be submerged under water.
    Sometimes called a bell pump, these pumps are located within the reservoir of water that
    needs pumping out. The motor is hermetically sealed and close-coupled to the body of the
    pump. With the components hermetically sealed they cannot be damaged by the liquid they
    are intended to pump.
    Submersible pumps are suitable for draining waste and clean water or sewage containing soft
    solids.</p>
     <h2> HOW DO SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS WORK?</h2> 
    <p class="fonts">A submersible pump operates by pushing, as opposed to drawing, liquid during the pumping
    process. Designed to pump excess water from flooded spaces, these robust pumps can
    continue working while fully submerged underwater. Pushing water requires less energy, than
    drawing water – making the submersible pump a popular choice for applications that require
    continuous operation.
    
    Submersible pumps need to be submerged to operate; this allows the motorized impeller to
    draw water into the pump. The submersible pump uses direct pressure through the hose to
    remove the fluid. This allows the pump to cover a greater distance than a suction pump.
    The submersible pump is a centrifugal pump; its impellers are designed to transfer rotational
    energy from one or more driven rotors. This movement gives water both kinetic and pressure
    energy. When the water passes each impeller, the pressure gain is multiplied.
    Submersible pumps use a float switch. This is used to monitor water levels and control the
    motor. The float switch will automatically turn off the motor when the water reaches a predetermined level. The float switch will reactivate the motor when required. Submersible pumps
    operate independently of user input and are fitted with an alarm to alert the occupier if there is
    a fault outside of scheduled maintenance.</p>  
 <h2> APPLICATIONS FOR SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS</h2> 
 <p class="fonts">Submersible pumps are very reliable. Due to the fact they are continuously submerged and
    therefore more difficult to access and maintain, submersible pumps are designed to be robust
    with a long life cycle.
    Submersible pumps are generally made with iron castings and protected against corrosion
    with coated epoxy. There are many applications for submersible pumps, including:</p> 
<ul>
    <li> Emptying Ponds
Dredging
<li>Water Wells</li>
    <li> Bore Holes</li>
    <li> Mines</li>
    <li> Marine Applications</li>
   <li> Flood Water Removal</li>
   <li> Sewage Treatment</li>
   <li> Sump Pumping</li>
     <li> Powering Water Features</li>
    <li> Draining Building Sites</li>
</ul>
 <h2>ADVANTAGES OF SUBMERSIBLE PUMPS</h2> 
 <p class="fonts"> <strong>Priming</strong>  : Submersible pumps are self-priming because they operate below the surface of the
    fluid to be pumped. There is no requirement to be primed.
    <br>
    <strong> Cavitation  </strong>: Submersible pumps are not prone to cavitation.
    <br>
    <strong> Efficiency</strong>: A submersible pump has the head pressure of the liquid on the suction end to help it
    operate. This means it does not require as much energy to draw in the liquid that requires
    pumping, resulting in a more efficient process.
    <br>
    <strong>  Noise </strong>: Because they are fully submerged, these pumps are generally quieter in operation.</p>

<h2>WHAT TO CONSIDER WHEN BUYING A
SUBMERSIBLE PUMP</h2>
<ul>

</ul>
<li> Type Of Water – Dirty Or clean?</li>
<li> Discharge Height</li>
<li>  Discharge Rate</li>
<li>  Power Back Up</li>
<li> Suction Depth</li>
<li> Outlet Size</li>
<li> Bore-Well Size</li>
